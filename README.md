# HealthClassifier

HealthClassifier is a simple Android application that utilizes machine learning in reading and classifying input medical data. Given user input into the application interface, the program uses a decision tree to match and classify data to learned patterns. Although this is an overly-complex solution, it demonstrates the potential of rudimentary machine learning in the medical field. This concept can be expanded to large datasets with multiple potential classifications by changing small parts of the program.
